So, my most recent problem: My Mum is required to email an invoice to her client fortnightly, and is fairly computer illiterate. This is handwritten and needs to be scanned as a PDF, and because Iâ€™m not around the house much anymore, my sister scans it for her, but she is too lazy to organise the email, so she adds it to my Dropbox so that, finally, I can email it to the client.
